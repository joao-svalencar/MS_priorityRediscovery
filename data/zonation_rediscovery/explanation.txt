We are going to run two prioritizations on global scale. One considering lost species, as defined by Lindken et al. (2024), and another considering all data deficient terrestrial vertebrates.

The weights were defined as the median of global Human Modification within a species range as defined by the IUCN (2025). Lost species should have a higher weight than DD?

Groups are defined by terrestrial vertebrates classes: 1. Amphibia, 2. Reptilia, 3. Aves, 4. Mammalia. Groups received the same weight rational.
